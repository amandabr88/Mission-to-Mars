# Mission-to-Mars

For this project, we used Flask web application that scrapes a website for data related to the Mars Mission and displays the information in a single HTML page.

Te main goal of this project is to give more functionality to the Robin's0 web app. To do so, we have added images of Mars’s hemispheres by scraping the website. 
Robin requiered to include all four of the hemisphere images. 
For this project, we have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
